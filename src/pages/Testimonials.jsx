      'We recently had the pleasure of working with Michelle Claborn during our search for a new home in Yuma, Arizona. Right from the beginning of the process Michelle gave us valuable advise and guided us in the search. All throughout the negotiation and closing Michelle was there quickly to handle any issues that arose. After buying the house we have continued to reach out to her with questions which she has always responded promptly. She is a true professional and we are grateful having her as our realtor. Michelle is amazing friend to the family, we love her energy. Thank you!',

      'We called Michelle when we decided to sell our home of 20 years. We were looking for a professional to work with, Michelle was just that. She made the whole ordeal seamless. She soothed every worry, eased every doubt. She got us top dollar for our home. We then decided to sell our rental house. Due to her intense networking she actually had an investor before we had to place it on the market! Michelle also assisted us with finding our final place to call home. She has been there for us, to answer all our questions and put up with a tough husband. She was available to us 24/7, always with an answer. I HIGHLY recommend Michelle for anyone\'s realtor needs. She is AWESOME!',

      'After over two years trying to sell my property in Yuma from across the country, I fired my realtor and luckily found Michelle. Michelle Claborn is an outstanding realtor! She is responsive, dedicated, knowledgeable and proactively worked to save me money. Prior to hiring her I asked her to assess the property and make recommendations. She noted a few maintenance issues, recommended cleaning up the appearance and proposed a low cost vendor to do the work. I hired her, had the recommended work done and in less than a week had an offer that recently closed! Michelle remained engaged after we were on contract. An agreed to concession included work done by a buyer selected contractor. Michelle learned of a less expensive contractor for the same work, coordinated with the buyer\'s agent and saved me $500! Michelle Claborn is a truly superb realtor and I would highly recommend her. It really was a pleasure to work with her and I thought she did an outstanding job selling our home in Yuma.',

Michelle Claborn you are the best! I text her last night @ 9:30 pm about my light fixture in the living room and today within an hour it was done. She is honest and truly looks after her renters.

She understood exactly what I was looking for and had showings lined up the day I arrived. We purchased from out of state and she was there for every step making the process as smooth as purchasing a house can be.
